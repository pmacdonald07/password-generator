Password Generator

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to create a functioning password generator that would create a password based on user needs. 

To complete this goal I did the following:
    Create a series of functions that activated when the "generate password" button was clicked.
    Created several smaller functions that handled individual tasks, such as creating a function to determine the password length, and another that consolidated arrays of characters based on which symbols the user wants in their password.
    Used local and global variables based on my functions' needs.
    Used if statements to determine the password length and character criteria.
    Used a for loop to cycle through the master array a number of times equal to the password length.

By completing this projects I've learned a great deal about using JavaScript. This took a lot of trial and error, but once I was able to break up the project into smaller parts it became manageable. As I coded this website I would find a solution to one problem that would generate another problem. Once I was able to tackle each of these and made it to the finish line, this became one of the most satisfying assignments yet.
